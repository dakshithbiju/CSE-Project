Main Function:

The main() function is the entry point of the program. It contains the core logic for the food ordering system.
It initializes the menu items, creates an empty cart, and displays the menu to the user.
The user is prompted to enter the index of the item they want to add to the cart. If a valid choice is made, the user is prompted for the quantity, and the item is added to the cart.
After the user finishes adding items to the cart, they have the option to edit the cart or proceed to buy.
If the user chooses to edit the cart, they can select an item from the cart and update its quantity.
If the user chooses to proceed to buy, an order summary and order confirmation details are displayed.
